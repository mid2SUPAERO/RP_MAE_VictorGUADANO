Aerostructural with wingbox (Q400)
==================================

This is an additional example of a multipoint aerostructural optimization with the wingbox model using a wing based on the Bombardier Q400.
Here we also create a custom mesh instead of using one provided by OpenAeroStruct.
Make sure you go through the :ref:`Aerostructural_with_Wingbox_Walkthrough` before trying to understand this example.

    :layout: interleave

The following shows a visualization of the results.
As can be seen, there is plenty of room for improvement.
A finer mesh and a lower optimization tolerance should be used.
