Structural Optimization Example
===============================

OpenAeroStruct can also handle structural-only optimization problems.
Here we prescribe a load on the spar and allow the optimizer to vary the structural thickness to minimize weight subject to failure constraints.
Although doing structural-only optimizations is relatively rare, this is a building block towards aerostructural optimization.
