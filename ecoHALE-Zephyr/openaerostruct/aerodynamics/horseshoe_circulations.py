class HorseshoeCirculations(ExplicitComponent):
    """
    Convert the previously-computed vortex ring circulations into horseshoe
    circulations. Vortex rings and horseshoe vortices produce the same linear
    space, but with a different parameterization. It's easier to compute the
    circulations using a vortex ring approach, but it's easier to compute the
    forces acting on the surface by using the horseshoe circulations.
    That's why we have this component, to convert from one circulation
    space to the other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    circulations[system_size] : numpy array
        The vortex ring circulations obtained by solving the AIC linear system.

    Returns
    -------
    horseshoe_circulations[system_size] : numpy array
        The equivalent horseshoe circulations obtained by intelligently summing
        the vortex ring circulations, accounting for overlaps between rings.
