class PanelForcesSurf(ExplicitComponent):
    """
    Take in the computed panel forces and convert them to sectional forces
    for each surface. Basically just takes the long array that has info
    for all surfaces and creates a new output for each surface with only
    that surface's panel forces.

    Parameters
    ----------
    panel_forces[system_size, 3] : numpy array
        All of the forces acting on all panels in the total system.

    Returns
    -------
    sec_forces[nx-1, ny-1, 3] : numpy array
        Only the panel forces for one individual lifting surface.
        There is one of these per surface.
